In 1881, they constructed three bridges called the Gates of Gotham, each bearing one of their names. Edward became jealous of the Wayne family during this period, jealousy that would spread to his great-great-grandson, Thomas Elliot or Hush. The occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by Peter Milligan's 1990 story arc 'Dark Knight, Dark City',which reveals that some of the American Founding Fathers are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old 'Gotham Town', its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves. A similar trend is followed in 2005's Shadowpact #5 by Bill Willingham, which expands upon Gotham's occult heritage by revealing a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built.";
