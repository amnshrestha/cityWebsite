Change Log
==========

1. Changed the Culture heading to Setting to better reflect the content. Subject matter was about cityscape not culture.
2. Made all card titles upercase for concistancy, some were full caps, some mixed case. Thought all caps was more effective than mixed-case.
3. The button on press image that make the title card blue, obscures the white text. Changed to bold yellow font on .select class. 
4. Added a space after "Chicago," on the Gotham card for legibility.
5. Changed the card layout from 3x2 to 2x3 to give more room for showing content by editing the style width and height of .eachCard
6. Added a link to more information on the TV-Show for more usability.
