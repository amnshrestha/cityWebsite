## Fonts being used
- Times

## Fonts added
- New Tegomin, serif
- Montserrat

In order to find these fonts, I went to [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Once I typed Gotham, among the options, New Tegomin seemed closest to the context.

As per the website, **New Tegomin** "takes inspiration from Mincho's clean and well organized appearance and the organic nature of handwritten letterforms."

Gotham is a fictional city where Batman is from. The city represents a place where there is chaos and violence while some people try and put order in it. The font when in english seems to have more gore which matches Gotham. Like Serif, they add "a distinctive wrinkle"

**Montserrat** was the font that was suggested by google font to go together with New Tegomin. In a paragraph, the characters and spread far enough to have a clean look. The characters are also very clear and sharp. This font goes good with New Tegomin in terms of legibility.

## Changes for readibility
I added a black background with alpha of 0.4 for the main text so that with the lighter background image of the webpage, the letters with white font color would be more readable. This helps create contrast between the letters and their background, hence, improving readability.
