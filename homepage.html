                Gotham is a fictional city appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, best known as the home of Batman. The city was identified as Batman's place of residence in Batman #4 (December 1940) and has since been the primary setting for stories featuring the character. Gotham is traditionally depicted as being located in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Gotham's look and atmosphere was primarily influenced by New York City and Chicago,although it was designed to more generally resemble any major American city.
